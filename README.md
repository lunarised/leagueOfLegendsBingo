# League of Legends Bingo

Created for my friend over at [twitch.tv/themolemessiah](https://twitch.tv/themolemessiah) for a fun wee minigame while he streams league of legends.

## Past
I first write this project in C# using Windows Forms. However, since .Net core needed to be installed, I decided to spend some time writing the project in other frameworks and languages, as both a way to get the application working great across all environments (preferably without downloading a framework on the users end), but also as a way for me to learn various GUI frameworks.

## Present
I am currently writing the project in Java using JFrames and JPanels. Mainly as i have spent a little time using them before. I will try to finish this before the end of August, but I intend to work on it casually.

## Future
I hope to port this to Rust in the future, to a few JS frameworks such as vue (maybe even write it in regular HTML?), and Python in the future as a way to learn some of their GUI frameworks. I am also going to attempt to learn the Win32 API for gui programming, simply to try and make the cleanest (my which I mean most out of the box) application possible
